            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              AADO is a women Led and an indigenous non - governmental
              organization legally registered in South Sudan with registration
              #2604. AADO was stablished in 2018 by volunteer professionals in
              South Sudan as a private, voluntary, nonpolitical, and
              nonsectarian organization. AADO national office is situated in
              Juba Na Bari next to Bilpam Road behind Shabele Petrol stations
              former IGAD offices.

              AADO opened its operations in South Sudan through partnership with
              other established organizations, government and county
              departments, and with network of private sector actors.

              child protection committees, extension workers, and WASH
              promoters. These structures have enabled AADO to competently
              provide community-tailored health care services, food security and
              livelihoods interventions, Protection support, and WASH services
              to underserved communities.
