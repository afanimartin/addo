            <h2>Peace Building</h2>
            <p>
              This is part of protection department deals with the issues of
              conflict management, mediation, reconciliation and forgiveness. We
              promote democratic principles, access to justice and create human
              rights awareness and empower communities with capacities on
              conflict management, mediation, reconciliation and good governance
            </p>
            <h2>Food security and Livelihood</h2>
            <p>
              This thematic area promotes sustained, inclusive and sustainable
              economic growth geared towards productive employment and decent
              work. Enhance resiliency and livelihoods security through
              increased household income and community-based disaster risk
              deduction and conflict mitigation.
            </p>
            <h2>WASH</h2>
            <p>
              AADO’s WASH Programme is predominantly community-based, the
              backbone of which is its community water, sanitation and hygiene
              activities. This department deals with interventions aimed at
              saving lives and reducing illness through access to safe water,
              adequate sanitation and improved hygiene through construction of
              boreholes, and rehabilitation dilapidated ones, building and
              renovating latrines and provision of WASH NFIs, and sensitization
              on hygiene issues.
            </p>
            <h2>Health Components</h2>
            <p>
              The health Programme works closely with health ministry given that
              epidemics are common in South Sudan and require both prevention
              and response when they occur. AADO has embarked on more
              facility-based interventions with the support of partners, given
              that access to formal health services is extremely limited in
              South Sudan. These interventions have primarily focused on
              maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH) given the extremely
              poor progress against Millennium Development.
            </p>
            <h2>Child Protection</h2>
            <p>
              This department employs holistic frame work to create an
              environment that promotes full respect for rights of individuals
              with special consideration for vulnerable groups of people like
              children and women. It responds to the protection needs of women
              and children who have experienced violence and abuse. Key areas
              are; child protection against abuses and exploitation,
              Gender-Based Violence and psychosocial care services.
            </p>
            <h2>Gender Based Violence</h2>
            <p>
              The project will address the gendered impact of violence, weak
              governance, lack of accountability and protection, lack of women’s
              access to multi sectoral GBV services including justice and the
              consequence thereof on women’s access to participation in peace
              building processes. This project will strengthen women’s agency
              and participation in local peace initiatives, including GBV
              prevention efforts, justice solutions, social cohesion and
              stability efforts. It is designed to address the social and
              structural barriers that prevent women’s participation both in the
              formal and informal peace process and in bottom up peacebuilding
              processes through fostering social cohesion between communities.
            </p>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>

              supports girl-child education, and trains education service
              providers. Promote girl-child education, empowering adolescent

            <p>
              Throughout this journey of 2 years, we had the great opportunity
              to work in cooperation with government as well as various partners
              along with cooperates such as Prime Projects and IsraAid, Dan
